# About the Game


Fight enemies: This game uses a turn-based combat system to battle enemies. Players can use items to help with fighting enemies.

Get stronger: Players can buy armor and weapons to make themselves stronger and prepare for the dragon fight!

Explore a 2D world: The world is displayed with emojis and the player can explore and interact with different objects represented by emojis!

Experience a story: Comic pages are available to read before the game starts and when the player defeats the final boss!

This app was made using Swift Playgrounds and meant to be run on iPad (any model). This game can be run in landscape and portrait orientations.

This game is my WWDC 2023 Swift Student Challenge Submission.
